# Gerrard leaves Al-Ettifaq after 18 months in charge

**Steven Gerrard has left his role as manager of Al-Ettifaq by mutual consent after 18 months in charge.**
The former Aston Villa and Rangers boss joined the Saudi Arabian club in July 2023.
Ex-England and Liverpool midfielder Gerrard [signed a two-year extension](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/</sport/football/68019672>) to his initial deal in January 2024, contracting him to the club until 2027.
But Al-Ettifaq have won just five of their 17 league matches this season, leaving them five points above the relegation zone.
"Football is unpredictable and sometimes things don't go the way we want," said Gerrard.
"However, I leave with great respect for the club and the country. I have no doubt that the work being done will bring success in the future and I wish the team the very best for the rest of the season.
"From the first day I was warmly welcomed and I have enjoyed the chance to work in a new country with a different culture.
"Overall I have learnt a lot and it's been a positive experience personally and for my family as well."
Al-Ettifaq club president Samer Al Misehal said Gerrard transformed the club.
"Sometimes things don't go as planned, but the firm foundations he helped build will guarantee a bright future in the long term," the president said.
"He changed the club for the better and that will never be forgotten. This decision, made with mutual respect and in agreement is in the best interest of both Steven and the club as we move forward."
After a stellar playing career with Liverpool and England, 44-year-old Gerrard began his managerial career with Rangers in 2018 and led the club to their first Scottish Premiership title in 10 years in 2020-21.
He succeeded Dean Smith as Villa manager in November 2021, but was sacked 11 months later after only 13 wins in 40 games.
Gerrard guided Al-Ettifaq to a sixth-place finish during his first season.
But he leaves with them 12th in a 16-team league, having won 23 of his 59 matches overall.
Gerrard was reportedly one of the best-paid managers in world football during his time in Saudi Arabia, on a salary of about Â£15m per year.
