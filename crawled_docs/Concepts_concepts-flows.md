# Flows
Flows in Langflow are fully serializable and can be saved and loaded from the file system. In this guide, we'll explore how to import and export flows.
## Import Flow[​](https://docs.langflow.org/Concepts/<#import-flow> "Direct link to Import Flow")
If you've already got a Langflow JSON file, import it into Langflow by clicking on the project name and choosing **Import Flow**.
![Import Flow](https://docs.langflow.org/assets/images/import-40c2fe54e0525650a955b4052d7abefc.gif)
Once imported, your flow is ready to use.
## Export Flow[​](https://docs.langflow.org/Concepts/<#export-flow> "Direct link to Export Flow")
The option to export a flow is available in the same menu as shown above. Once exported as JSON, you can import your flow into another Langflow instance.
